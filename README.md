# hudu-api
A simple Hudu API wrapper made in python for something I have to develop at work

## Requirements ## 
- Make sure to have requests pip package installed
- Hudu API Key, consult to the [Hudu Documentation](https://support.hudu.com/hc/en-us/articles/11422780787735-REST-API) on how to obtain it

## Disclaimer ##
- This is a very simple implementation I did for work, will not be actively maintained
- Only supports GET requests for now
- Any functions about passwords require extra permissions from the Hudu API
